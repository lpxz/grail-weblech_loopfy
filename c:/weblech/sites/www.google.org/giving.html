                Giving back is part of our corporate DNA. In 2011, we provided $115 million in
                grants and more than $1&nbsp;billion of in-kind support to nonprofits and academic
                institutions. Google employees also contributed 40,000 paid volunteer hours helping
                organizations around the world. Learn more about our major initiatives&nbsp;below.

              Nonprofit organizations have been hit hard by today’s economic uncertainty yet, in
              times like these, their vital services are needed more than ever. We are grateful for
              the millions of Google users who have helped us grow and do our part to help
              charitable organizations who are working tirelessly to make the world a better place.

              Google Gives Back
            </h4>
            <p>
              In 2011, we provided $40 million in financial support to organizations focused on
              education in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM); girls
              education—particularly in developing countries; modern slavery and sex-trafficking;
              and technology empowerment.

              Disaster Response
            </h4>
            <p>
              In the wake of a disaster, we provide immediate cash grants to critical first
              responders. We then research and provide grants to additional organizations, mostly
              local, working on long-term recovery efforts. We’ve donated more than $8 million to
              disaster relief since 2005.

            <p>
              Our offices and data centers around the world are deeply tied to their local
              communities. Community Affairs helps local offices support surrounding schools,
              nonprofits and small businesses in ways that play to Googler competencies and
              passions and deliver on needs in each community.

              Employees at Google like to give back—and we encourage it. Of the many volunteer
              programs and gift matching initiatives we support, most were started by Googlers
              themselves.

              Employee Gift Matching
            </h4>
            <p>
              When employees give cash contributions to nonprofits, we match them, providing tens
              of millions of dollars for charitable work around the globe.

              GoogleServe

            <p>
              Each June, we encourage Googlers to leave their desks for a day to participate in
              service projects in their communities ranging from cleaning graffiti to trail
              maintenance to teaching prisoners. We call this program GoogleServe. In 2011, more
              than 7,700 Googlers tackled more than 400 projects in 119 cities around the world.

              Dollars for Doers
            </h4>
            <p>
              Many nonprofits rely on donations and volunteers to accomplish their work. Our
              Dollars for Doers program contributes in both ways. For every five hours a Googler
              volunteers at a nonprofit of his or her choosing, we donate $50 to that nonprofit. In
              2011, the program generated over 18,500 hours of volunteered time.

              Google was born out of a Stanford dorm room, and we continue to value our connection
              to academia. We devote significant <a href=

              across an array of subjects. We also cultivate ties with the academic community to
              ensure that the next generation of passionate thinkers and brilliant breakthroughs
              are on the way.

              We sponsor workshops and high school education initiatives in engineering, math and
              science through our RISE Awards. We also run a Google Scholarship program that
              provides PhD candidates with financial support and Google mentors. To date, we’ve
              supported 2,100 Google Scholars, many of them for minorities and women, with more
              than $8.8 million in scholarship funds.
