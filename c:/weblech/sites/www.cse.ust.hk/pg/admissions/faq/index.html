<p id="app-form"><b>Q1. Where can I get an application form?</b></p>

<p>Application forms are available from the <a 
href="http://www.ab.ust.hk/arr/adm/">ARR Admission office</a>. This web site 
also provides more detailed information about how to fill out and submit the 
application.</p>

<p id="deadline"><b>Q2. What is the application deadline?</b></p>

<p>Applications for admission to postgraduate programs in September of the 
year are invited from January onwards. The <a 
href="http://www.ust.hk/provost/pg/admissions/RPG/deadline.html#eng">official 
application deadline</a> for all CS programs will be in June.</p>

<p>MPhil application will be processed in a batch immediately after the 
deadline passes. So, as long as they are submitted after the deadline, all 
MPhil application will be treated equally. PhD applications will be 
processed on a continuous basis as they arrive at ARR; qualified applicants 
will be accepted only until all places are filled. So, if you are applying 
for the PhD program, apply as soon as possible.</p>

<!--
<p id="x03"><b>Q3. Can I apply directly to the PhD program, skipping the 
Masters?</b></p>

<p>You may, but preference will be given to students who already have 
completed, or are completing, a MPhil or MEng degree. We do occasionally 
admit exceptionally qualified students directly from the UG program to PhD 
studies. If you are interested in pursuing this option further please 
contact the PG coordinator for further information.</p>
-->

<p id="mphil"><b>Q3. How good do I need to be to be accepted as a
MPhil student?</b></p>

<p>There are no hard-and-fast rules for admission to the MPhil program. We 
rank applicants based on our judgment of their background and general 
ability to do a research thesis. In practice this usually means that the two 
most important criteria are your CGA and your letters of recommendation.</p>

<p>Good letters of recommendation are essential. A letter from a faculty 
member that states he/she is willing to be your research supervisor is even 
better (but uncommon); one that states that she/he is willing to supervise 
you AND fund your studentship directly out of his/her research grants is 
even better (but even rarer). We want to emphasize that the CGA is not 
everything. An applicant with a very strong letter of recommendation might 
be admitted over one with a slightly higher CGA but weaker letters.</p>

<p>In the past most students with <tt>B+/A-</tt> CGA or above (the exact 
CGA varied from year to year)and good letters were accepted. The exact 
number of students accepted depends upon many factors including number of 
studentships available to the department and a forecast of the number of 
students expected to graduate that year.</p>

<p id="letter"><b>Q4. Whom should I ask to write my two letters of 
recommendation?</b></p>

<p>The letters of recommendation are used to judge your ability and fitness 
to be a MPhil student so you should ask someone who knows you well enough to 
write something substantial about you, including your creativity, 
intelligence and ability to do research.</p>

<p>Your FYP advisor is a good choice. Another possibility is the instructor 
of any course that you did very well in (a useful `trick' is to find a 
course that you really enjoy and are doing well in and make sure that the 
instructor knows who you are as a person, not just as a name and number on 
assignments. One way of doing this is by asking good questions in class. 
Another is to go to the instructor after class and ask for extra reading 
material and then discuss it with him/her. Who knows; you might even find an 
advisor this way.</p>

<p>Finally, if you've worked outside UST, especially in an IT related job, 
you can ask your supervisor for a letter.</p>

<p id="studentship"><b>Q5. Will I receive a studentship from the department to 
support my studies?</b></p>

<p>The current department guideline is that all MPhil students are provided 
with a guaranteed ten month postgraduate studentship (PGS) and all PhD 
students with a twelve-month one. Studentship support after this first ten 
or twelve month period is dependent upon satisfactory work and the student 
finding a research supervisor; support for second year PG students is 
arranged between the student's supervisor and the department (sometimes as a 
Research Assistant paid out of the supervisor's research grants and 
sometimes as a Teacing Assistant paid by the department) and not directly 
between student and department.</p>

<p id="part-time"><b>Q6. Can I apply for part-time studies?</b></p>

<p>We normally prefer to accept applicants who are applying for full time 
studies. Only in special cases as described below, will we accept part-time 
applicants.</p>

<p>For applicants to the MPhil and PhD program the applicant must already 
have found a faculty member who has agreed to be the applicant's thesis 
supervisor.</p>

<p id="non-local"><b>Q7. I am not from Hong Kong. Can I still apply for a PG 
program in your department? Can I apply for a studentship from your 
department?</b></p>

<p>Anyone, no matter where they are from, can apply to our department. We 
will normally not grant studentship's to non-local MPhil students, though. 
That is, under normal circumstances non-local students will not be eligible 
to receive studentships from the department when studying for the MPhil. 
They are eligible for such studentships, though, when studying for the PhD 
program.</p>

<!--
<p id="x09"><b>Q9. I do not have a computer science undergraduate degree or 
master's degree. Can I apply to your programs?</b></p>

<p>We do not require our applicants to have a previous degree in computer 
science. We do require, however, that all of our incoming PG students, 
MPhil, or PhD, already have studied the material covered in our courses 
COMP180, COMP251, COMP252, and COMP271. PhD students are also required to 
have taken the equivalent of COMP272 (short lists of course contents are 
appended below). The reason for this requirement is that we consider this 
material essential background knowledge for anyone attempting advanced 
studies in computer science. In general, an applicant who is missing three 
or more of these required courses will not be considered, while a student 
who is missing only one or two of these courses is sometimes admitted but 
with the provisional condition that he/she must take the missing courses 
after arriving here and receive at least a B grade in all such courses.</p>

<div class="frame">
<p>COMP 180 Computer Organization<br />
Inner workings of modern digital computer systems and tradeoffs at the
hardware/software interface. Topics include: instructions set design, memory
systems, input/output systems, interrupts and exceptions, pipelining,
performance and cost analysis, assembly language programming, and a survey of
advanced architectures.</p>

<p>COMP 251 Principles of Programming Languages<br />
Comparative studies of programming languages, programming language concepts 
and constructs. Non-imperative programming paradigms; object-oriented, 
functional, logic, concurrent programming. Basic concepts of program 
translation and interpretation. Storage allocation and run-time 
organization.</p>

<p>COMP252 Principles of System Software<br />
Principles, purpose and organization of systems software; processes, tasks, 
scheduling, interprocess communication, synchronization, mutual exclusion; 
memory management; device management; file systems, security and protection, 
multi-CPU systems, computer networking and distributed computing. (Note: in 
many schools most of this material is taught in an operating systems 
course.)</p>

<p>COMP 271 Design and Analysis of Algorithms<br />
Time and space complexity analysis of algorithms. Design paradigms: 
divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. Graph 
algorithms: searching and backtracking, connectivity, biconnectivity, 
minimum spanning tree, shortest path. NP-completeness.</p>

<p>COMP 272 Theory of Computation<br />
Introduction to automata, formal languages, and computability. Set theory and
countability. Finite automata and regular languages. Push-down automata and
context-free languages. Turing machines. Church's thesis. Halting problem.
Uncomputability.</p>

<p id="toefl"><b>Q8. Do I need to take the TOEFL exam?</b></p>

<p>As a general rule we require that all non-local students must take the 
TOEFL exam. The only exceptions to this rule are students who received 
their undergraduate degree in an English speaking institute.</p>

<p id="info"><b>Q9. Where can I get further information about PG 
studies?</b></p>

Engineering department Postgraduate Program Co-ordinator:</p>
