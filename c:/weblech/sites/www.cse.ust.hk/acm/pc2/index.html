Since 2004, in the HKUST Local Programming Contest, all the contestants will use PC<sup>2</sup> to submit
their source code to the judge. This is a brief introduction to the usage and the interface
of PC<sup>2</sup>. For those of you who do not have any contest experiences, you are highly recommended
to attend the trial run in the morning before the real contest in order to familiarize yourselves
this piece of software.<br>
<br>
With PC<sup>2</sup>, contestants can submit source codes, ask for clarifications
and view the submittion status during the contest. When you start running PC<sup>2</sup>, you will be prompted to
enter your login and password, which will be given to you before the contest.<br>

<br>
After successful login, you will see there are only four tab-pages. The first one is for you to
submit your source code. You should select the problem that you are going to submit, the programming
language (in our case, only C/C++ can be chosen) and the source file from the local system.<br>

In the second tab-page, you can ask for the clarification from the judge if you think some of the
problem statement is not clear enough. The judge will response to you through PC<sup>2</sup> as well.<br>
