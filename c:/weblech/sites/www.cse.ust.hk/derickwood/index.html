<p>With deep grief and great sadness, we are writing to share with you the 
sad news about the passing of our Professor Emeritus, Professor Derick 
Wood, on October 4, 2010, at the Sunnyside Home in Ontario, Canada.</p>

<p>Derick joined the Department of Computer Science, HKUST as Professor on 
January 2, 1995 and have been our faculty for over 10 years until his 
retirement on June 30, 2006. During the period September 2001 to June 
2002, Derick was appointed as Acting Head of the Department. He was 
conferred the title Chair Professor in January 2006, and has been our 
Professor Emeritus since his retirement.</p>

<p>During his career at HKUST, Derick contributed not only in the areas of 
teaching and research; he also served in many committees at the 
department, school and university level. He was highly respected not only 
by his colleagues in the department, but also by many others in the 
university who had a chance to know him or work with him. To his 
students, Derick has always been a most dedicated and caring teacher. 
His death is a profound loss to his family, friends, colleagues and 
students.</p>

<p>The funeral service for Derick will take place in the morning of 
October 16, 2010 at a funeral home in Ontario, his home town where he 
spent the last years of his life with his beloved family. Visitations for 
friends will be held in the evening of October 15 in the same funeral 
home. Details can be found at the following link:</p>

<p>Derick is dearly missed by all the people who have the luck of getting 
to know him in person. Although he has left this earth, his warmness, 
generosity, and great sense of humour will never be forgotten.</p>
