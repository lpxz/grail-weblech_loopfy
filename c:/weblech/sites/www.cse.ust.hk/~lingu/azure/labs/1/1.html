<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Windows Azure Platform is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
The services hosted in Windows Azure consist of one or more web roles or worker roles.
A web role is typically a front-end application written with ASP.NET.
A worker role is a back-end application which is processed in the background without user interfaces.
A Windows Azure service may be comprised of one or both types of roles and can run multiple instances of each type.
Instances of roles can be added or removed on demand.
The applications can scale quickly and economically up or down when the need changes.
</p>
<p>
Windows Azure storage services provide scalable storage in the cloud, which includes the Blob service for storing text and binary data, the Table service for structured storage that can be queried, and the Queue service for reliable and persistent messaging between services.
</p>
<p>
In this series of labs, you will design a simple calendar application to learn many features of the Windows Azure platform, including the web role and the table storage.
</p>
<p>
In the calendar application, a web role provides the front-end that allows users to view the events and add new entries. When user picks up a date on the calendar, the web role queries the table storage to list all the events on that day. To add an event, the web role creates a new entry in the table storage with the event name, time and date submitted by the user.
</p>

In this lab, you will design a web interface for the calendar with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.
<H2>Details</H2>
<P>
<H3>Task #1 - Creating the Visual Studio Project</H3>
In this task, you will create a new Cloud Service project in Visual Studio 2010.
<p>
1. Open Visual Studio as administrator from <b>Start | All Programs | Microsoft Visual Studio 2010</b> by right clicking the <b>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010</b> shortcut and choosing <b>Run as administrator</b>.<br>
2. If the <b>User Account Control dialog</b> appears, click <b>Continue</b>.<br>
3. From the <b>File menu</b>, choose <b>New</b> and then <b>Project</b>.<br>
<!--<center><img src="1-1.jpg"></center><br>-->
4. In the <b>New Project</b> dialog, expand the tree of <b>Visual C#</b> in the <b>Installed Templates</b> list and select <b>Cloud</b>.
In this lab, you are supposed to develop your calendar with Visual C#. 
Choose the <b>Windows Azure Project</b> template, set the <b>Name</b> of the project to <b>calendar</b>, set a location for the solution files, change the solution name to <b>calendar</b>, tick the <b>Create directory for solution</b>. Click <b>OK</b> to create the project.<br>
<center><img src="1-2.jpg"></center><br>
5. After setting the language, name and location of the solution, you are asked to add roles to the Azure project.
In the <b>New Windows Azure Project</b> dialog, inside the Roles panel, expand the tab for <b>Visual C#</b>, select <b>ASP.NET Web Role</b> from the list of available roles and click the arrow (<b>></b>) to add an instance of this role to the solution. <br>
<center><img src="1-3.jpg"></center><br>
6. Before closing the dialog, select the <b>WebRole1</b> in the right panel, which is added in step 5.
Click the pencil icon and rename the role as <b>Calendar_WebRole</b>. 
Click <b>OK</b> to create the cloud service solution.<br>
<center><img src="1-4.jpg"></center><br>
Congratulations! You have successfully created a Windows Azure Project.
There are currently some sample code in this project which are automatically added by Visual Studio.
<br>
<table bgcolor="#dddddd">
	<tr>
		<td><img src="../image/point.gif"> Note</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
There are two projects in this solution currently. The project,
named <B>calendar</B>, holds the configuration for the web and worker roles that compose the cloud application.
It includes the service definition file, <b>ServiceDefinition.csdef</b>, which contains metadata needed by the Windows Azure fabric to understand the requirements of your application, such as which roles are used, their trust level, the endpoints exposed by each role, the local storage requirements and the certificates used by the roles.
The service definition also establishes configuration settings specific to the application.
The service configuration file, <b>ServiceConfiguration.cscfg</b>, specifies the number of instances to run for each role and sets the value of configuration settings defined in the service definition file.
This separation between service definition and configuration allows you to update the settings of a running application by uploading a new service configuration file.
<p>
The <b>Roles</b> node in the cloud service project enables you to configure what roles the service includes (web, worker or both) as well as which projects to associate with these roles.
Adding and configuring roles through the <b>Roles</b> node will update the <b>ServiceDefinition.csdef</b> and <b>ServiceConfiguration.cscfg</b> files.
<p>
Another project, named <b>calendar_WebRole</b>, is a standard ASP.NET Web Application project template modified for the Windows Azure environment.
It contains an additional class that provides the entry point for the web role and contains methods to manage the initialization, starting, and stopping of the role.

In the following task, we will build this project and execute it on our local machine with the Windows Azure compute emulator.<br>
<H3>Task #2 - Launch the Azure Application in the Emulator</H3>
The Windows Azure compute emulator can be used to simulate the environment for developing and testing Windows Azure applications on your local machine.
In this task, you will launch the sample Azure application automatically created by Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 in the previous task in the emulator.
<p>
1. Start the Windows Azure compute emulator from <b>Start | All Programs | Windows Azure SDK v1.4 </b> by clicking the <b>Compute Emulator</b>.
In the task bar (typically located at the right-bottom conner of your desktop), you will see the compute emulator icon (<img src="emulator.jpg">).<br>
2. Right click the compute emulator icon and choose <b>Start Storage Emulator</b>.<br>
Now, you have started the compute emulator.
<center><img src="1-5.jpg"></center><br>
3. Right click the compute emulator icon and click the <b>Show Compute Emulator UI</b> to load the user interface of the compute emulator.<br>
<center><img src="1-6.jpg"></center><br>
4. In the Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, you can now build the project from <b>Build | Build Solution</b> and start it from <b>Debug | Start Debugging</b>.
Visual Studio will automatically deploy the project to the compute emulator.<br>
In the compute emulator UI, you will see the execution details of the web role.<br>
<center><img src="1-8.jpg"></center><br>
After the execution, the web role will show the user a welcome page in the browser.<br>
<center><img src="1-9.jpg"></center><br>
<H3>Task #3 - Designing the Web Interface for the Calendar</H3>
The web interface is a key component in our calendar to interact with the user.
In this task, you will design a web interface with ASP.NET.
<p>
1. Before creating your own web pages, you need to clean up the pages automatically added by Microsoft Visual Studio when creating the project.
In the <b>Solution Explorer</b> window, right click "default.aspx" and choose <b>Delete</b>.<br>
<!--<center><img src="1-10.jpg"></center><br>-->
2. Create a new main page by right clicking the <b>Calendar_WebRole</b> in the <b>Solution Explorer</b> and choosing <b> Add | New Item </b> in the menu.<br>
3. In the <b>Add New Item</b> dialog, choose the item type of <b>Visual C# | Web | Web Form using Master Page</b> and set its name to be <b>default.aspx</b><br>
4. Rright click the <b>default.aspx</b> in the source file tree in the <b>Solution Explorer</b> and choose <b>View Designer</b> to design the page in a WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) way. Add a <b>Calendar</b> control to the page by double clicking the <b>Calendar</b> control from the toolbox. (If the toolbox does not appear in your Visual Studio window, open it from <b>View | Toolbox</b>.) Set the ID of the added Calendar control to be <b>Calendar_date</b> in the <b>Properties</b> panel.<br>
<center><img src="1-11.jpg"></center><br>
5. Add the other controls in the same way. 
The types and IDs of the controls need to be added are listed below.
<center>
<table width=200>
	<tr align="center">
		<td>Control Type</td>
		<td>Control ID</td>
