<h2>Windows Azure Technology</h2>
<p>
The Windows Azure Platform is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft.
It provides an easy-to-use cloud development platform with a set of system services running in the backend datacenters.</p>
<p>
From a programmer's view, the services hosted in Windows Azure consist of one or more web roles or worker roles.
A web role is typically a front-end application written with ASP.NET.
A worker role is a back-end application which is processed in the background without user interfaces.
A Windows Azure service may be comprised of one or both types of roles and can run multiple instances of each type.
Instances of roles can be added or removed on demand.
The applications can scale quickly and economically up or down when the need changes.

We have designed a set of labs to explore the Windows Azure technology.
