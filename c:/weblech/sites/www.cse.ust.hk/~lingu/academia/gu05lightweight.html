<h3>Abstract: </h3>
<p>A wide variety of sensors have been incorporated into a spectrum of wireless 
  sensor network (WSN) platforms, providing flexible sensing capability over a 
  large number of low-power and inexpensive nodes. Traditional signal processing 
  algorithms, however, often prove too complex for energy-and-cost-effective WSN 
  nodes. This study explores how to design efficient sensing and classification 
  algorithms that achieve reliable sensing performance on energy-and-cost-effective 
  hardware without special powerful nodes in a continuously changing physical 
  environment. We present the detection<br>
  and classification system in a cutting-edge surveillance sensor network, which 
  classifies vehicles, persons, and persons carrying ferrous objects, and tracks 
  these targets with a maximum error in velocity of 15%. Considering the demanding 
  requirements and strict resource constraints, we design a hierarchical classification 
  architecture that naturally distributes sensing and computation tasks at different 
  levels of the system. Such a distribution allows multiple sensors to collaborate 
  on a sensor node, and the detection and classification results to be continuously 
  refined at different levels of the WSN. This design enables reliable detection 
  and classification without involving high-complexity computation, reduces network 
  traffic, and emphasizes resilience and adaptation to the realistic environment. 
  We evaluate the system with performance data collected from outdoor experiments 
  and field assessments. Based on the experience acquired and lessons learned 
  when developing this system, we abstract common issues and introduce several 
  guidelines which can direct future development of detection and classification 
  solutions based on WSNs.</p>

<p>Section 4.3, Equation (3) should be:</p>
<p>v_{2,t} = \alpha_2(E_t - m_{2,t})^2 + (1-\alpha_2)v_{2,t-1)</p>
<p>Initially, m_2,0 = 0 and v_2,0 = 0</p>
