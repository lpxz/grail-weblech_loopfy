  <li id="prepare">
    <strong>How should I prepare for an interview?</strong>

    <p>Get a good understanding of the company that you applied for. For
    example, for a minimum, one should get an overview of the business /
    industry activities, company information including locations, number of
    staff and profile, goals and visions.</p>

    <p>One should further learn about the recent happenings to the company
    and the industry and business. Such information can be obtained through
    media or people who are in the industry. Try to talk to people who are in
    the industry, as these people have the experience and can share with you
    how the real situation is.</p>

    <p>Some interviewers like to ask questions on your final year project or
    your software engineering course project. You should organize how to
    present the technical details (e.g., database design, user interfaces and
    system architecture) as well as your technical accomplishment before the
    interview. I have received comments from companies that some HKUST
    applicants are not well prepared as compared with other applicants when
    they attend interviews in February or March. Please check with your final
    year project team mates to clarify the details so that you have a good
    overall picture of your final year project.</p>

    <p>In addition, have the necessary documents such as original and copies
    of official certificates and transcripts ready, resume being kept
    up-to-date and equip yourself with some passport-sized photos as well as
    some stationery as companies may require you to fill in forms or proceed
    on for tests.</p>

    <p>Stay calm and have enough rest to feel good for the interview. Arrive
    about 10-15 minutes earlier for an interview and never be late.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="ask">
    <strong>What questions should I ask in an interview?</strong>

    <p>Towards the end of an interview, interviewees are often checked
    whether they have any question to ask. You should ask questions that show
    your enthusiasm towards joining the company. For example, ask some
    questions about the company's future plan and development. Do not ask
    factual questions which can be found easily in publications or company
    homepage. This gives the interviewer a bad impression that you are not
    well prepared and are not interested in this job.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="dress">
    <strong>Should I dress well even for an aptitude test?</strong>

    <p>There is varying opinion in this. For me, I believe that one should be
    professional in any stages of the selection process. Proper attire can
    create good impression and this may help you in gaining further
    opportunities.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="tricks">
    <strong>What are the common tricks in an interview?</strong>

    <p>Be attentive and patience to whatever challenges that the interviewers
    present to you. If possible, try to get to know who your interviewers are
    so that you know who your target audiences are. It is common to have an
    interview whereby interviewers ask questions to get to know more about
    the candidate. Try to create an impression within a short period of time
    by structuring your answers in an easy to understand manner. Hence,
    preparation for common interview questions is essential. Common questions
    include introducing yourself, reasons of why you are suitable for the
    post. Such questions may be answered in English, Cantonese, Mandarin or
    other languages depending on the requirement of the interviewers.</p>

    <p>Companies like to recruit employees with broad exposure and enthusiasm
    in information technology. For example, they might give priority to
    applicants who participated activities beyond their course studies.
    Examples are UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunities), President Cup,
    various contests, developing some interesting mobile apps or
    participating into open source projects as an amateur.</p>

    <p>In addition, there can be written tests including IQ test,
    psychological test, essay-writing test, numerical test, test specific to
    the industry (such as computer code writing on the spot).</p>
  </li>
  <li id="accountant">
    <strong>What is the life of an accountant?</strong>

    <p>There are various fields one can develop their career in accounting,
    including audit, tax, corporate finance, forensic. Attention to details,
    cautious, interest and commitment to the profession are some of the
    qualities being looked for in an accountant profession. Accountants
    usually work long hours, especially during peak season such as month-end
    or year-end closing.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="it_developer">
    <strong>What is the life of an IT developer?</strong>

    <p>Depending on what level of IT developer one is in, the level of skills
    and qualifications vary. In general, one needs to get an understanding of
    what is the deliverables for the project, pay attention to the time
    schedule and meet them accordingly. Good interpersonal skills as well as
    professional project management skills are something being looked
    for.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="mainland">
    <strong>What are the job opportunities in mainland?</strong>

    <p>As China entered into the World Trade Organization and with the
    implementation of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA),
    there are ample job opportunities for Hong Kong students in the
    Mainland.</p>

    <p>To be able to seize the opportunity, the minimum requirement would be
    proficiency in Mandarin. It would be an added advantage if one can write
    simplified Chinese if the job involves correspondences with parties in
    China.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="enterprises">
    <strong>When do large enterprises start their recruiting
    processes?</strong>

    <p>It depends on different companies. There are usually career talks and
    seminars held by large enterprises on a yearly basis or whenever there is
    an urgent need to do recruiting. Such enterprises usually advertise such
    upcoming event via university notice board and via media such as their
    company webpage. Hence it would help to be on the look out for
    information by paying attention to your surroundings.</p>

    <p>Some companies do selective recruiting process by approaching
    professors in university. Consult your professors in university for
    information.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="phone">
    <strong>What attentions should I pay to when conducting a phone
    interview?</strong>

    <p>In general, it is not a good idea to conduct a phone interview using
    mobile phones. If you really need to do so, please make sure that (i) you
    are in a quiet place, (ii) the reception quality is good, and (iii) your
    phone has enough battery. If you receive an interview call on your mobile
    phone, you may politely ask the interviewers if you can call back using a
    wired phone.</p>
  </li>
  <li id="other">
    <strong>Other important issues:</strong>

    <p>Don't just send out mass email letter. Do research on the company. If
    possible, find out if you know someone who have worked there. Understand
    their culture, core competencies and products will give you a very big
    advantage. Write down the list of companies that you have applied for a
    position. The background about the companies will give you the background
    to ask some meaningful questions, especially at the most critical time.
    Write your resume with meticulicous attention and passion. Treate it as
    the most important document you have ever written. If you consider
    yourself presentable, attach a password photo with your resume.</p>

    <p>It may be good to conduct some mock interviews with others, even with
    your fellow students. The mock interview will go over points you make in
    your resume. Do ask your potential employers questions, ask them
    politely. And do not stop after you have found out the salary, fringe
    benefits, and vacation time. Do ask them what activities do the staff do
    together. Show them you are a team-person. Show them you have good IQ and
    EQ.</p>

    <p>If you are seriously planning to develop a career in China, learn
    Putonghua. If you demonstrate your interest and commitment you may land
    on a job that may give you more growth potential in China than getting a
    in-between-jobs job. If your academic work is slightly inferior than
    others. Make sure you have some points to sell (but avoid hard sell).
    Most employers are concerned with the individuals ability, but at the
    same time, group communication and teamplay. A good communicator, both
    verbal and written, is just as important of a success element as a good
    technican. Double check what you have written in your Web site and what
    are the related links. If you do receive a phone call, treat it with
    care. Make sure you understand who you are talking to. Write their email
    and phone number down. More recap some of their questions after the phone
    interview--you may find it useful later on. Return an thank you email or
    letter. Recap one or two important points. Be confident and vigilent. Do
    not give up. Be ready to accept that a good job is hard to find.</p>

    <p>The candidate should send in their application as soon as possible
    instead of waiting until the dead line. Also the application letter
    should be tailored towards the company instead of using the "templates".
    Hand in the letter to language center for spelling and grammar check.
    Visit the career center more often and talk to the counselors. Talk to
    people you know who work in the company/industry. Research on the web.
    Practice your English and perhaps have some mock-interview to help build
    confidence.</p>

    <p>When writing resume, be honest in the IT skills. Maybe classify the
    skills as proficient, self studied, elementary etc if you really want to
    write as much as possible. During interview, calm down and be honest on
    what you know and accept what you don't know. Remember that you are new
    to the industry. Don't feel shame if you don't know some topics. Show
    what you will do to improve your knowledge in that areas. You have to
    present why you are enthusiastic and interested in this position whenever
    possible.</p>
