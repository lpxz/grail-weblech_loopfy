<h2>Answers</h2>

<h3>Recommended Study Pathway</h3>

<p class="question" id="pattern-deviate">May I deviate from the recommended 
study pathway?</p>

<p>Normally you should follow the <a 
href="http://publish.ust.hk/prog_crs/ugprog/pathways.html">"recommended" 
study pathway</a> for required courses. Deviations may delay your 
graduation due to prerequisite and course offering constraints. However, 
you may deviate from the elective recommendations by seeking an advice 
through <script type="text/javascript"><!--
  mmsend('ugadvice'); //--></script>, or talk to your COMP 4900 academic adviser and/or <a href="/ug/advising/">advising team</a>.</p>

<p>The recommended email request format is as follows:</p>

<div class="fbox">
<pre>
Title: Request to have a deviation from the recommended study pathway

Content:
Name:  
Year of Study:
Attachment: The latest unofficial transcript and your deviated study plan
</pre>
</div>

<p>Requests deviated from the above format may not be entertained.</p>

<p>You also need to check the <strong>UG Curriculum</strong> at the <a 
href="http://www.ust.hk/provost/ug/">Undergraduate Studies</a> for the 
course requirements of your program. The undergraduate curriculum by years 
is also available at the <a 
href="http://www.ust.hk/provost/ug/curriculum_hb.html">Undergraduate 
Curriculum Handbook</a>.</p>

<p class="question" id="pattern-deviate2">I failed a required course/I 
transferred from another program. How can I follow the recommended 
study pathway?</p>

<p>Cases like these may require deviating from the recommended 
study pathway. Since a customized study pathway is needed, the 
current ARR system cannot pre-register you in required courses that you 
take in semesters different from the recommended ones. Please feel free to 
discuss with your COMP 4900 academic adviser and/or <a href="/ug/advising/">advising team</a> if you need help in customizing your 
study pathway.</p>

<p class="question" id="pattern-dropreq">Can I drop my pre-registered required 
course?</p>

<p>The department helps you to pre-register a few fundamental core 
courses. We usually don't recommend student to drop these courses since it 
may lead to defer of graduation. If you have carefully considered your 
study pathway and decided to drop the course, please raise such request in 
SIS. You may be asked to contact our academic counselor to further discuss 
this before approval. Please note once the drop request is granted, the 
department won't help you to pre-register that particular course in the 
future.</p>

<h3>Curriculum Changes</h3>

<p class="question" id="curriculum-changes">Changes have been made to our 
curriculum. Should I follow the old or new one?</p>

<p>The curriculum published in the Academic Calendar of the year you 
entered your current Computer Science program is the one that you should 
follow. However, some subsequent curriculum changes may also lead to 
slight changes in the existing curriculum and recommended 
study pathway. Such changes are announced to all students concerned 
as soon as they are approved by the University. Please check the 
<strong>UG Curriculum</strong> at the <a 
href="http://www.ust.hk/provost/ug/">Undergraduate Studies</a>.</p>

<h3>Semester Workload</h3>

<p class="question" id="workload-normal">Do I need approval if my number of 
credits exceeds the recommended one? Please note that the answer to this 
question is only applicable for students without receiving an academic 
probation or an academic warning.</p>

<!--
<p>Yes, you need to seek explicit approval for all credit overloading. 
Please discuss with your COMP 4900 academic adviser and/or <a href="/ug/advising/">advising team</a> for the approval of your credit 
overloading. Please discuss with your adviser well in advance before 
course registration because your adviser may be out of town during your 
course registration.</p>

<p>We also offer a simplified approval process if you intend to overload 
not more than TWO credits beyond the normal load AND your <tt>(CGA + TGA 
&gt; 4.0)</tt> AND you are not in unsatisfactory academic performance AND 
you are not a first year student. After you have submitted your credit 
overloading request at Student Information System (SIS), you can initiate 
the simplified approval process by sending an email <strong>with subject 
"Credit Overload Request for Simplified Approval Process"</strong> to 
ugcoord @ cse.ust.hk using your ITSC account. Note that we do not process 
emails from non-ITSC email accounts. In your email, please state 
clearly</p>

<ol>
<li>your name,</li>
<li>student ID,</li>
<li>year of study,</li>
<li>number of overloading credits (either 1 or 2),</li>
<li>your CGA,</li>
<li>your TGA, and</li>
<li>the reason for credit overloading.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please also attach a copy of your transcript in your email.</p>

<p>A conversion table from course grade to points is given below for your 
information.</p>

<p>In general, overloading is discouraged. The reason is that you can 
benefit more by doing well in your coursework with a normal load. Failing 
some courses in the past is not a good reason for overloading, as 
overloading often leads to more academic problems. Taking summer courses 
is a better alternative to overloading.</p>

<p>Below are the tentative guidelines that your COMP 4900 academic 
advisor (or UG coordinator if your academic advisor is not available) may 
reference when considering your overloading request.</p>

<ul>
<li>For Year 2 Fall semester, overloading is not allowed.</li>
<li>For Year 2 Spring semester, overloading is not recommended as the 
three required COMP courses need substantial programming efforts. If your 
CGA is <tt>A</tt> (i.e., <tt>4.0</tt>) or above, you may overload by up to 
3 credits.</li>
<li>For Year 3, overloading is not recommended. If your CGA is <tt>A</tt> 
(i.e., <tt>4.0</tt>) or above, you may overload by up to 4 credits.</li>
<li>For year 4, if your CGA is <tt>C</tt> (i.e., <tt>2.0</tt>) or above 
AND TGA is <tt>C</tt> (i.e., <tt>2.0</tt>) or above, you may overload by 
up to 4 credits.</li>
</ul>
-->

<p>In each semester, the suggested credit load is 15 credits. The ARRO 
allows students to take up to 18 credits. If you would like to take more 
than 18 credits, you <strong>MUST</strong> seek an explicit approval.</p>

<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> We offer a simplified approval process 
subject to the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Year 2 students
<ul>
<li>If your CGA is <tt>A-</tt> (i.e., <tt>3.7</tt>) or above, <strong>you 
can take a maximum of 20 credits</strong>.</li>
<li>If your CGA is <tt>C</tt> (i.e., <tt>2.0</tt>) or above, <strong>you 
can take a maximum of 19 credits</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Year 3 or 4 students
<ul>
<li>If your CGA is <tt>A-</tt> (i.e., <tt>3.7</tt>) or above, <strong>you 
can take a maximum of 22 credits</strong>.</li>
<li>If your CGA is <tt>C</tt> (i.e., <tt>2.0</tt>) or above, <strong>you 
can take a maximum of 20 credits</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We apply stricter rules for Year 2 students in the simplified approval 
process because they are relatively new to their declared major.</p>

<p>The approval request can be submitted on SIS as follows ("Class Enroll 
Approval Request" -&gt; "Add Course Approval Request"):</p>

<img src="../workload-normal.png" width="640" height="267" 
alt="Class Enroll Approval Request -&gt; Add Course Approval Request" />

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If you would like to overload more credits 
than the conditions stated in Method 1, please discuss with your 
COMP 4900 academic adviser and/or <a href="/ug/advising/">advising 
team</a> for the approval. You should seek an advice well in advance 
before the course registration because your adviser may be out of town 
during your course registration.</p>

<!--p id="workload-under"><strong>I will be in my final semester of study. 
The number of course credits that I need is below the normal workload by 
more than two credits. Do I still need approval?</strong></p>

<p>The current ARR system still requires you to get approval from the UG 
coordinator, but the approval is very straightforward.</p-->

<p class="question" id="probation">I am on academic probation / academic 
warnings. I must take a reduced study load. How many credits should I 
take?</p>

<p>A student on academic probation / unsatisfactory academic performance 
is subject to a REDUCED study load as follows unless otherwise advised by 
the academic advisor of the student:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not more than 9 credits for a student on academic probation with 
<tt>TGA &lt; 1.0</tt>;</li>
<li>Not more than 12 credits for a student on academic probation with 
<tt>TGA &ge; 1.0</tt>; and</li>
<li>Not more than 12 credits for a student on academic warnings (but not 
academic probation) with <tt>TGA &lt; 1.0</tt>; and</li>
<li>Not more than 15 credits for a student on academic warnings (but not 
academic probation and <tt>TGA &ge; 1.0</tt>) with <tt>(CGA + TGA) &lt; 
3.4</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Course Registration Problems</h3>

<p class="question" id="course-registration">Under what circumstances are 
special add-quota requests granted?</p>

<p>From time to time, ARR, upon recommendation of departments, add 
'special quota' during the add/drop period for cases without which the 
graduation or academic progress of students will be seriously hampered. 
However, as a standard practice, quotas will not be added for specific 
students to take their preferred ELECTIVES.</p>

<p>The following are some of the categories of cases that ARR has accepted 
upon the recommendation of course/major departments.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dual program &ndash; students
    who have declared dual program designation.</li>
  <li>Minor program &ndash; students
    who have declared minor program will need assistance to enroll for minor
    program courses to complete the program requirements.</li>
  <li>Course re-take &ndash;
    students who need to re-take failed courses, mostly required courses.</li>
  <li>Program transfer &ndash;
    students who have transferred between programs may have difficulties in
    getting into required courses of the new program.</li>
  <li>Required courses &ndash;
    students who cannot meet the course pre-requisite requirements and failed
    to be pre-registered to required courses.</li>
  <li>Exchange program &ndash;
    exchange-in students may need certain course places to fulfill degree
    requirements of their home institutions.</li>
  <li>Medical reasons &ndash; some
    students may have medical problems that affect their choice of courses or
    class time.</li>
  <li>Canceled courses/classes
    &ndash; students who are affected by the department's decision to cancel
    a course/class after their enrollment is confirmed.</li>
  <li>Student project &ndash;
    subject to the support of course instructor and project supervisor (and
    sometimes major department), class quota may be added for some students
    who need to take a specific course which directly equip themselves for
    completion of final year project.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be emphasized that these are not rules for deviation from the 
waitlisting system, rather they are precedent cases that we have come 
across in the past few years. For more information on the course 
registration system, visit <a 
href="http://arr.ust.hk/reg/cr/cr_std_ug/regug_intro.html">Course 
Registration of UG Students</a>.</p>

<p class="question" id="course-require">I have to take a required course in a 
different semester than that specified in my recommended 
study pathway. The course has not been pre-registered for me and the 
class is full. What should I do?</p>

<p>Examples of circumstances in which students have to take a required 
course in a different semester than that specified in the recommended 
study pathway are: failure in a previous attempt, deviation from 
study pathway due to study leave/internship/exchange 
program/previously required to take a reduced study load.</p>

<p>You should submit an add request using the course registration system, 
leaving a short note explaining your case. Due to the physical limit of 
computer labs and classrooms, as well as the fact that there are 
fluctuations in the enrolment numbers during the add/drop period (first 
two weeks of class), we may have to wait till the second week of the 
add/drop period to add special places for such students. Please go ahead 
and attend the lecture/lab/tutorials. If your problem is still unresolved 
by the beginning of the second week of the add/drop period, please send an 
email to our Executive officer Ms. Eva Tam at <script type="text/javascript"><!--
  mmsend('etam'); //--></script>.</p>

<p class="question" id="course-conflict">One of my pre-registered required 
courses has time conflict with another course that I would like to take. 
I'd like to swap to another section, but that section is full. Can the 
department help me?</p>

<p>If the time conflict is with another <em>required</em> course that has 
not been pre-registered for you (e.g., honors-track courses, courses that 
you have failed before), please first submit an add/swap request using the 
course registration system, and then send an email to Ms. Brenda Tam at 
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
  mmsend('csbrenda'); //--></script> specifying the courses you have timetable conflict and 
which lecture/tutorial/lab section(s) you can attend. Please inform us as 
soon as possible since such requests require us to liaise with other 
department (e.g., LANG, MATH) and the ARRO.</p>

<p>As a standard practice, if the time conflict is with an 
<em>elective</em> course that you wish to take, the department CANNOT help 
you to swap lecture/tutorial/lab section. The ARR have very strict rules 
on additions of special quota. Please submit a swap request using the 
course registration system. If the swapping request is unsuccessful, you 
simply have to try to take that elective in another semester.</p>

<p class="question" id="course-isom2500">Can I use ISOM 2500 (Business 
Statistics) to substitute MATH 2411 as required course requirement?</p>

<!--p>No. Please also note ISOM 2500 is exclusive to MATH 2411.</p-->

<p>Even though ISOM 2500 is exclusive to MATH 2411, you should not 
substitute it for the required course requirement. You should take ELEC 
2600, IELM 2510, or MATH 2421 to fulfill it. The ISOM 2500 may then be 
counted toward your electives.</p>


<h3>Course Grades &amp; Grade Averages</h3>

<p class="question" id="grade-retake">After passing a course, can I retake it 
to get a better grade?</p>

<p>No. The University does not allow students to repeat a passed 
course.</p>

<p class="question" id="grade-gga">What is the difference between CGA, TGA and 
GGA? How are they calculated?</p>

<p>For CGA (Cumulative Grade Average) and TGA (Term Grade Average), please 
refer to the section 8, Grade Averages, of the <a 
href="http://publish.ust.hk/acadreg/ugreg/">Academic Regulations</a>.</p>

<p>For GGA (Graduation Grade Average), please refer to the section 12.2, 
Graduation Grade Average (GGA), of the <a 
href="http://publish.ust.hk/acadreg/ugreg/">Academic Regulations</a>.</p>

<p class="question" id="grade-count">Do my failed courses count towards my 
GGA?</p>

<p>Failed courses will not be automatically excluded from students' GGA. 
You have to apply for the exclusion. Exclusion of graded courses is 
subject to the following conditions:</p>

<ol>
<li>No course required for the award of the student's degree may be 
excluded;</li>
<li>No more than 12 credits may be excluded. Please note the 12 credits 
mentioned above includes those failed courses.</li>
</ol>

<p>Reference: Section 12.2, Graduation Grade Average (GGA), of the <a 
href="http://publish.ust.hk/acadreg/ugreg/">Academic Regulations</a>.</p> 

<h3>Course Offering Pattern</h3>

<p class="question" id="offering-comp">What is the offering pattern for COMP 
courses?</p>

<p>Whether a course will be offered in a particular semester depends on 
many factors. To give students more flexibility in planning their study we 
try to offer core, required, and popular elective courses as frequently as 
possible, preferably every semester. See the <a 
href="/ug/courses/">courses</a> to be offered in the coming semesters. 
Note that the actual offering schedule may vary slightly from year to 
year.</p>

<p class="question" id="offering-others">Does COMP 1021/1022P/1022Q count as 
Engineering Fundamental or common core courses?</p>

<p>If you take one of the above courses, it can be used to satisfy both 
COMP required course, Engineering Fundamental course, and common core 
requirements. This is a special arrangement for COMP major student. 
However please note the credits of any single course can never be counted 
twice although the same course may be used to satisfy multiple 
requirements.</p>

<!--p id="offering-0405"><strong>Which COMP courses will be offered in this 
academic year?</strong></p>

<p>All courses mentioned in these two files: <a href="fall2005.htm">Fall 
2005</a>, <a href="spring2006.htm">Spring 2006</a> (there may be some
