<h1>Academic Advising</h1>

<p><strong>Q: Where can I find the program catalog, course catalog and 
academic regulations for my studies?</strong></p>

<p>Related information is available at <a 
href="http://publish.ust.hk/prog_crs/">Program/Course Catalog &amp;
Academic Regulations</a>.</p>

<!--
<p><strong>Q: I have learned programming in high school and I am already a 
competent programmer. Can I take other COMP courses besides COMP 1004 
(COMP 104) in the first semester of study?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you may take COMP 2021 (COMP 111), provided you have passed HKALE 
Computer Studies or HKCEE Computer Studies, or obtained approval from the 
course instructor to waive COMP 1004 (COMP 104) as the pre-requisite. 
However, you are not recommended to take more than the normal study 
load.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I have learned programming in high school and I am already a 
competent programmer. Can I take other COMP courses besides COMP 1004 
(COMP 104) in the first semester of study?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you may take COMP 2012 (COMP 152) or COMP 2021 (COMP 111), 
provided you have obtained grade <tt>B</tt> or above in HKALE Computer 
Studies, or obtained approval from the course instructor to waive COMP 
1004 (COMP 104) as the pre-requisite. However, you are not recommended to 
take more than the normal study load.</p>

<p><strong>Q: My curriculum needs me to take COMP 1004 Programming 
Fundmentals &amp; Methodology, but it's not offered any more. What should I 
do?</strong></p>

<p>You should take COMP 2011 Introduction to Object-oriented Programming 
instead, and apply course substitution. Please approach CSE admin office 
Ms. Brenda to obtain the substitution form. For those who failed COMP 1004 
before and retake COMP 2011, no pre-enrollment will be arranged. If you 
haven't taken any of COMP 1021/1022P/1022Q, you need to apply for 
pre-requisite exemption via SIS before registering COMP 2011, and it's 
subjected to COMP 2011 course instructor's approval.</p>

<p><strong>Q: COMP 2021 (COMP 111) is a 2000-level elective, can I take it 
in Year 1?</strong></p>

<p>Unless you have strong programming background prior to joining UST, you 
are NOT advised to take COMP 2021 (COMP 111) in the first year of study. 
You should try to learn the basics of programming [e.g., COMP 1004 (COMP 
104)] well in the first semester, and then focus on the three required 
COMP courses which involve substantial programming efforts in the second 
semester. It is important to build a good foundation in Year 1 in order to 
handle more advanced courses in Year 2 and 3.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I plan to pursue graduate studies. Which electives are 
recommended?</strong></p>

<p>You are recommended to take the 4-credit MATH courses in place of the 
2-credit version [e.g., MATH 2121 (MATH 111) instead of MATH 2111 (MATH 
113)]. In addition, you might want to take COMP 3721 (COMP 272), which is 
a required course for our PhD program. It is also advisable to take more 
mathematics courses (to fulfill the COMP/ELEC/MATH elective or FREE 
elective requirements). Some basic MATH courses relevant to CS are 
Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, Ordinary 
Differential Equations, Partial Differential Equations, Numerical 
Analysis. For more advanced MATH courses, please seek advice from your 
academic advisor or the UG Coordinator.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I am interested in taking some foundation ELEC courses, are 
there any recommendations?</strong></p>

<p>In addition to ELEC 1100/2410 (ELEC 125/101) which is a required course 
for COMP/CSIE students, other foundation ELEC courses are ELEC 2200 (ELEC 
151), ELEC 2100 (ELEC 211), and ELEC 3110 (ELEC 212). Digital Signal 
Processing is a useful fundamental course for several CS areas such as 
Image/Video/Speech Processing, Computer Graphics, and Computer Vision. 
<!--You may also take ELEC 2600 (ELEC 210) in place of MATH 2411 (MATH 
144) (remember to fill the GR-14 form before your graduation 
check).--></p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I take a more advanced course to substitute a required 
course in my curriculum?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can. For example, you may take MATH 2121 (MATH 111) to replace 
MATH 2111 (MATH 113), MATH 2023 (MATH 101) to replace MATH 2011 (MATH 
100), MATH 2421 (MATH 241) to replace MATH 2411 (MATH 144), and MATH 2352 
(MATH 151) to replace MATH 2351 (MATH 150). This is useful for students 
who plan to <a href="http://www.math.ust.hk/ug/programs/minor.shtml">minor 
in MATH</a> or declare <a href="/bsc/">CS-MATH double major</a>. The extra 
credits earned can also be counted as FREE credits.</p>

<p>You should <em>swap</em> from your pre-registered required course to 
the 4-credit course, rather than <em>drop</em> the former and <em>add</em> 
the latter. The request to drop the pre-registered required course will 
only be approved when a seat has been successfully reserved for you to 
take the 4-credit version. Please inform Ms. Brenda Tam at 
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
  mmsend('csbrenda'); //--></script> when you secure the seat. <strong>Warning:</strong> 
Once you give up your reserved seat for the required course, should you 
decide later that the advanced course does not suit you, the department 
CANNOT help you to secure the seat back if the course is full. You have to 
queue for a place, and if failed, try to register for that course in 
another semester.</p>

<p>Please be reminded to fill the course substitution form (GR-14) 
available from the CS General Office prior to your graduation check.</p>

<p><strong>Q: May I take SOSC 1100 before taking MATH 2411? If so, how are 
the credits counted?</strong></p>

<p>SOSC 1100 is a more elementary statistics course than MATH 2411. It is 
possible for students taking SOSC 1100 before taking MATH 2411. However, 
the course contents in SOSC 1100 do not provide a more general education 
than MATH 2411, which is required by COMP/CSIE curriculum. The credits 
earned in SOSC cannot be counted towards Common Core/Designated General 
Education for 3-year study program. Students in 3-year study program may 
count the credits earned in SOSC 1100 towards Free electives.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I would like to pursue a minor program, how can I plan for 
it?</strong></p>

<p>You should plan well ahead if you are interested in pursuing a minor 
program. You should make use of the your electives (for both COMP and 
CSIE) to take courses that can be used to fulfil the requirements of the 
minor program. The ELEC/MATH electives or ENGG elective may be useful for 
pursuing certain minor programs such as MATH, Bioengineering, Technology 
Management. HSS GEE courses can be used to satisfy the requirements of 
Humanities/Social Science minor programs. More details on recommendations 
for pursuing <a href="/ug/minor/">minor programs</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I may enroll in the double-major CS-MATH program in the 
second year. How can I prepare for this transfer in the first 
year?</strong></p>

<p>You may follow the recommended study pattern of COMP or CSIE, but take 
the 4-credit MATH courses instead of the 2-credit ones required by 
COMP/CSIE. In addition, you should try to take a MATH course in place of 
GEE/FREE in the first-year study pattern.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I didn't do well in COMP 1004 (COMP 104) and I am worried 
that I cannot handle the three programming-related courses COMP 151, COMP 
171, and COMP 2611 (COMP 180) in the second semester. Can I delay taking 
any of these required courses?</strong></p>

<p>COMP 1004 (COMP 104) is an important fundamental course for Computer 
Science students. In the unfortunate event that you have only narrowly 
passed COMP 1004 (COMP 104), you are strongly recommended to delay taking 
either COMP 2012 (COMP 152) or COMP 2611 (COMP 180). You should seek 
academic counseling from your academic advisor or the UG Coordinator.</p>

<!--p><strong>Q: I failed COMP 1004 (COMP 104), but it will not be offered 
next semester. What should I do?</strong></p>

<p>You have to take COMP 1002 (COMP 102) and COMP 1003 (COMP 103) 
simultaneously to substitute for COMP 1004 (COMP 104). Special approval is 
needed as COMP 1002 (COMP 102) is the prerequisite of COMP 1003 (COMP 
103). You should also fill the course substitution form (GR-14), available 
from the COMP Admin Office, for approval of the UG Coordinator and SENG.</p-->

<!--p><strong>Q: I wish to transfer between COMP and CSIE. Can I use ELEC 
2410 (ELEC 101) to substitute for ELEC 2400 (ELEC 102), or vice 
versa?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, if you transfer from COMP to CSIE, you can substitute ELEC 2400 
(ELEC 102) by ELEC 2410 (ELEC 101). Note that ELEC 2400 (ELEC 102) is not 
a prerequisite for any required course in CSIE, although it does provide a 
deeper exposure to electrical engineering than ELEC 2410 (ELEC 101). 
However, since ELEC 2410 (ELEC 101) has 4 credits and ELEC 2400 (ELEC 102) 
has 5 credits, there will be a shortfall of 1 credit. You have to make up 
for this shortfall by taking one extra COMP/ELEC credit.</p>

<p>If you transfer from CSIE to COMP, the extra 1 credit from ELEC 2400 
(ELEC 102) can be used to satisfy the FREE credit requirement.</p-->

<p><strong>Q: I wish to transfer between CSIE and COMP programs, which 
have different MATH required courses. Do I have to take extra MATH 
courses?</strong></p>

<p>If you transfer from CSIE to COMP, you must add MATH 2011 (MATH 100). 
If you transfer from COMP to CSIE, you must add MATH 2351 (MATH 150).</p>

<p><strong>Q: What if I am not able to attend final 
examination?</strong></p>

<p>If students wish the University to take into account illness or some 
other extenuating circumstances that have affected their performance in an 
examination, or ability to attend an examination, or to complete other 
assessment activities, they must report the circumstances of the case in 
writing and provide appropriate documentation to ARRO within one week of 
the scheduled date of the assessment activity. Please refer to <a 
href="http://arr.ust.hk/reg/em/em_std_reg/reg_makeup.html">Illness 
or Other Circumstances Affecting Assessment</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Where can I find information on the credit transfer of 
courses taken during exchange-out periods?</strong></p>

<p>Related information is available at <a 
href="http://www.seng.ust.hk/web/eng/fourcat.php?samepage=yes&amp;catid=2&amp;subid=42&amp;thirdid=65&amp;fourid=66">Courses 
and Credit Transfer</a> from SENG (login required).</p>

<p><strong>Q: I have encountered problems in academic study. What do I 
need to do before meeting with my academic adviser?</strong></p>

<p>If you understand that you are in unsatisfactory academic progress 
(UAP) or have received a warning letter from the University, you are 
strongly advised to complete the <a 
href="Academic_Progress_Review.doc">Academic Progress Review Form</a>, 
send it to your adviser together with the supplementary information, and 
seek advice from your academic adviser.</p>

<h2>Further Questions</h2>

<p><strong>Whom should I talk to about other academic problems?</strong></p>

<p>You should approach your academic advisor, i.e. your COMP x900 
instructor, or the UG coordinator
