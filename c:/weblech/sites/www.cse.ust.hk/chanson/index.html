 Dear colleagues, 
 
 With deep grief and great sadness I am writing to break the 
 sad news about the passing of our beloved colleague, 
 Professor Sam Chanson, who passed away on August 26, 2005 
 in the Hong Kong Adventist Hospital. 
 
 Professor Sam Chanson joined the Department of Computer 
 Science in 1993, at which time HKUST was still a relatively 
 new university with a handful of faculty who were attracted 
 to start their career in this challenging place from various 
 distinguished institutes in the world.  During his career at 
 HKUST, he not only earned the respect from his peers as a 
 great researcher, but also from many students who had an 
 opportunity to learn from him as one of the most dedicated 
 and loving teachers.  His death is an fathomless loss to his 
 family, friends, colleagues and students. 
 
 There will be a funeral service for Sam on September 11, 2005 
 (Sunday) at 2:30 pm in the Kowloon Tong Church of the Chinese 
 Christian & Missionary Alliance located at no. 134, Waterloo 
 Road.  **Friends and colleagues who wish to pay their last 
 respect to him may attend the service on that day. 
 The Chansons would like to thank any offer of condolence 
 money and flowers, but it is their wish that in lieu of 
 flowers, wreath and condolence money, donations be made to 
 the Kowloon Tong Chinese Alliance Church instead. ** 
 
 Sadly, Lionel

Dear faculty, staff, students, and others,

It is with great sadness and sympathy that I am writing to 
inform you of the passing of Prof. Sam Chanson this morning 
(August 26, 2005) in Kwong On Hospital, Hong Kong.

Sam is a world renowned researcher in real-time systems, 
security, and distributed systems. He has fight with the lung 
cancer for over 2 and a half years. During this tough period, 
he showed his dedication to the university and his students 
by attending almost all important meetings, replying all emails, 
and reading all students' research papers. Two of his PGs 
successfully defended their PhDs in the last few months. When 
Sam showed up with wheelchair and suffering great pain, I 
learned what a great teacher is. Every time I visit him in 
hospital, he cared about the department, new hiring, etc.

I am asking you to join me, in whatever way is your custom, to 
take a moment to offer your prayers, your private reflections, 
your expressions of sympathy, support, etc., to and for Prof. 
Chanson and his family at this time of great loss, the death of 
a highly respected faculty at HKUST.

As of now, arrangements of visitation and services have not been 
made.  For those who wish to support some causes as a memorial, 
more information will be forthcoming.

Sadly,

Lionel
