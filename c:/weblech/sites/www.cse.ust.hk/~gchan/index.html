<p>I conduct applied system research on multimedia and wireless 
networking, addressing critical  industry-driven and operational
  challenges to support cost-effective  
large-scale services.&nbsp; In contrast to
  &quot;theoretical&quot; or  
fundamental research, my team has been working closely with companies
  to study and  
develop novel, distributed and deployment-ready systems which advance the field.&nbsp; 
We apply rigorous algorithmic and optimization techniques to relentlessly close 
practice-theory gaps so that our systems operate under the most general and 
realistic network environment.&nbsp; The systems we developed are not
  simply
proof-of-concept prototypes, but can be fully integrated into
  industrial operations with  
unmatched performance in their running.&nbsp; I keep a strong 
team of researchers (postdocs, PhD and MPhil candidates) and regular engineering 
staff, whose work closely knit together so that 
our research results drive engineering excellence while deployment
  challenges drive our research agenda.
<!--
long-term research goals and 
practical implementation issues are properly aligned and tightly --
  --coupled.&nbsp; 
-->
Our work 
has been extensively supported by leading companies such as Boeing,
China Mobile, Cisco,  
Google, HAECO, HP, Huawei, Modern Terminals Ltd. (HK), Mei Ah Entertainment, Microsoft, TCL, 
 Tencent,  
etc.</p>
<p>Widely known for their practical nature, 
my projects have won several awards and been of direct impact to
  industry. They have been 
  demonstrated and deployed with remarkable success.
