          Recently, due to the advance of pervasive sensing and computing, heterogeneous data are generated at
    unexpected scale and complexity. Data originates from any different domains, such as sensor networks,
    medical images, scientific measurements, financial transactions, web-interactions and social media.
    These data are everywhere and exist along the time with different types of representations.
    Thus, the “BIG Data” concept is introduced to describe these enormous data. So far, there is no clear definition
    about BIG Data, according to wiki, “Big data are datasets that grow so large that they become awkward to
    work with using on-hand database management tools. Difficulties include capture, storage, search, sharing,
    analytics and visualizing. “Clearly, managing and analyzing BIG data have many challenges.
    In this workshop, we mainly focus on discussing some killer applications (opportunities) brought by the Big Data,
    such as Geo-Crowdsourcing, Product Recommendation, and Human Motion Tracking, etc.
    The workshop will be featured with six talks and a panel discussion.

              GeoCrowd: Harnessing the Power of Crowd for On-Demand Geographical Data Collection
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              GeoCrowd is a web-based crowd-sourcing platform (similar to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk) that matches geo tasks (i.e., tasks associated with a specific location and time such as “Take pictures of Tommy Trojan during 2012 USC-UCLA game”) to human workers.  Every person with mobile devices can now act as a multi-modal sensor collecting various types of data instantaneously (e.g., picture, video). With GeoCrowd, subscribers can publish tasks with specific space and time attributes.  Subsequently, the workers (with GeoCrowd mobile app) can perform the tasks if they are at the right time and at the right place and upload the results to the GeoCrowd server(s). In this talk, I first introduce our generic framework for GeoCrowd and discuss various techniques for optimal assignment of spatiotemporal tasks to human workers. Next, I show how we can extend this framework to incorporate trust in GeoCrowd in order to ensure workers satisfy a confidence value given by the task requester.  Finally, I will show an application of the GeoCrowd framework in a commercial domain.

                SAP HANA and its Extreme Applications
              <h5>Abstract</h5>

              SAP HANA is an in-memory data platform that is deployable as an appliance, or in the cloud. At its core is an innovative in-memory relational database management system which makes full use of the capabilities of current hardware (RAM and multi-core CPUs) to increase application performance, to reduce cost of ownership and to enable new scenarios and applications that were not possible before. This speed-up processing capability from HANA could help existing applications to achieve the goals that would be considered impossible in the past , and also help to re-design and improve current business process flow in enterprise; especially on top of big data. In this talk, I describe the architectural design of SAP HANA and its solutions for big data. Finally, I will present some “extreme applications” on HANA, which are designed to deal extremely large data set or extremely complex problems (i.e. search space).

              <!--<span class="prof">Prof. Cha</span> worked on three generations of in-memory database (IMDB) systems since he joined Seoul National University(SNU) in 1992. All these technologies were commercialized.   In 2000, he founded Transact In Memory, Inc. on campus for funding R&D of his second-generation in-memory database called P*TIME, and in 2002, he established its parent company in Silicon Valley.  In late 2005, Transact In Memory, Inc. was quietly acquired by SAP AG, and later transformed to SAP Labs Korea after a period of stealth operation. With SAP’s funding, by early 2006, Prof Cha’s team completed the world-first implementation of innovative in-memory OLTP database features in P*TIME: in-memory MVCC, compressed prefix B+-tree with optimistic latch-free index concurrency control [VLDB01, Cha et al], and tight integration with SAP’s application server. By SAP’s request, Prof. Cha continues to lead SAP Labs Korea team and has been playing a critical role in the birth and maturing of SAP HANA in tight collaboration with German colleagues. Prof. Cha received his PhD in Database Systems at Stanford, and MS and BS from SNU, respectively.  He worked for DACOM, Texas Instruments, and HP Labs. From time to time, he serves university duties with roles like SNU Foundation Finance Committee member and the social duty of an external board member of KT. <br/> Prof. Cha is the general co-chair of IEEE ICDE 2015 Conference to be held in Gangnam, Seoul, Korea in the beautiful cherry blossom time of mid-April, and currently serves on the editorial board of VLDB Journal and on Industrial PC of VLDB 2014 Conference.-->

              Big Data has become a popular phenomenon as more data being generated from the activities online, and some successful early attempts to derive useful insights out of the data by various businesses. We believe at present, Big Data is in its infancy and more exciting time will come when better analytical methods are being developed and more varieties of data become available. In this talk, we will try to understand the Big Data analytics applications and explore ways where the Big Data can be used to enable more intelligent services for enhancing people's life.

              User Modeling in Social Networks and Social Media
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              The ever-growing social networks and social media provide invaluable sources of information for modeling the behavior of users. High-quality user models enable superior services and functions for end users.  In this talk, I will present several examples of user modeling based on social networks and social media.  I will first describe our research in modeling users' information preferences on Microblogs using a novel user message model.  I will then discuss our work on extracting users' daily activities, such as dining and shopping, that inherently reflect their habits, intents and preferences. I explain our novel transfer learning solution via a collaborative boosting framework comprising a text-to-activity classifier for socially connected users.  I will also describe our research on user modeling in multiple, overlapping social networks in a “composite social network”  setting.  I will show the benefits of modeling the dynamics of composite networks, where the evolution processes of different networks are jointly considered. Finally, I will explain our research on finding social spammers in large social networks.

              User understanding from large scale human behavioral data.
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              With the rapid development of ubiquitous computing technologies, especially positioning, device and sensor technologies, a large scale of human behavioral data have become available. They reflect various aspects of human activities in the physical world, thus, connect users' digital lives and their physical lives. Here, human behavioral data fall into several different domains, such as mobility data, interest data, and social media data. The growing availability of these behavioral data provides us an unprecedented opportunity to acquire individuals' personal information as well as their digitalized behaviors. In this talk, I will present a number of our recent research works on this direction : 1) Influence of social behaviors on user mobility 2) user activity recommendation and prediction; 3) social graph de-anonymization; 4) human lifestyle analysis.

              Crowdsourcing over Big Data, a new human computing challenging?
              <h5>Abstract</h5>
              Recently, the popularity of crowdsourcing has brought a new opportunity to engage human intelligence into the process of various data analysis tasks. Compared with computer systems, crowds are good at handling items with human-intrinsic values or features. Existing work develop sophisticated methods by utilizing the crowd as a new kind of processors, a.k.a HPU (Human Processing Unit). As a consequence, tasks executed on HPU are called HPU-based tasks. Meanwhile, huge volume of data are generated every day, we are in the era of Big Data. Thus, a nature question arises: is crowdsouring over Big Data a new human computing challenging? In this talk, I will discuss the answer to the above question and explain the key issues related to effective crowdsouring.
