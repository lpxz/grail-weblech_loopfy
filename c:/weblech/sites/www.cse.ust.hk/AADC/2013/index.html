<p class='subtopicOrange'><strong>Why Do We Learn Android Programming?</strong></p>
		  <p class='tinyWhite'>Android is the most popular mobile platform and over half of mobile users get use to it. It is necessary to learn how to programme in an Android mobile device. In the workshop we offer you a basic startup to programme using Android SDK.
</p>
		  <p class='tinyWhite'>The workshop is designed for an independent, practical, fun way of learning the Android programming and getting a real feel for the implementation. The workshop is mainly conducted in English with some Cantonese. </p>
      <p class='subtopicOrange'><strong>What Tools Are Used in the Workshop?</strong></p>
            <p class='tinyWhite'>Before you start to experience of programming in Android, you would prepare several things. First, you should have a computer. And its operating system can be Windows, Mac OS or even Linux. Please follow the steps to install the Android Software Developement Kit (SDK) and Eclipse IDE on your own computer:
            </p>
            <div align=left class='tinyWhite'>
            <ol>
              <li>Before getting started with the Android SDK, take a moment to confirm that your development computer meets the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" class="orangelink">System Requirements</a>. In particular, you might need to install the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" class="orangelink">JDK</a>, if you don't have it already. </li>
              <li>Install the Android SDK for your operating system that is available at the following link:                <br />
                <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" class="orangelink">http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a><br />
                Download the above  Android to your windows C: drive and unzip them. Once installed, you can go to the folder you have chosen to install and start the SDK.
                <strong><br>
                NOTE: the files are over 1G in size. </strong></li>
              <li>If you would like to install the SDK from your existing Eclipse Java IDE tool, find the detailed instructions on how to install Android SDK and Eclipse IDE at
              <a class="orangelink" href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html">http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html</a></li>
            </ol>
            </div>
      <p class='tinyWhite'>[Optional] You can also try the Android Studio which is similar to Eclipse with the ADT plugin. This is a early access preview of Android development environment and several features are yet incomplete: <a class="orangelink" href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html ">http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html </a><br>
